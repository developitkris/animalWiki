        <h2>DIET</h2>
Orcas feed on fish, squid, birds, and marine mammals. Like dolphins, orcas use echolocation - bouncing sound off of objects to determine their location - to hunt and use a series of high-pitched clicks to stun prey.

Did You Know?

The orca's large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 35mph!

Members of orca pods very often work together to catch a meal. Pod members sometimes will force many fish into one area and then take turns feeding or will beach (slide out of the water onto the shore) themselves to scare seals or penguins into the water, where other killer whales are waiting to feed.

<h2>POPULATION</h2>
Official worldwide populations of orcas are currently unknown, but likely not to be less than 50,000 individuals.

<h2>RANGE</h2>
Did You Know?

Many orcas live with their mothers for their entire lives!

Found in all oceans of the world, orcas are most common in the Arctic and Antarctic and are often spotted off the west coast of the United States and Canada. Orcas are found in both coastal waters and open ocean.

<h2>BEHAVIOR</h2>
Orcas are highly social animals that travel in groups called pods. Pods usually consist of 5 - 30 whales, although some pods may combine to form a group of 100 or more. Orcas establish social hierarchies, and pods are led by females. The animals are thought to have a complex form of communication with different dialects (slightly different language) from one pod to another.

<h2>REPRODUCTION</h2>
Orca gestation is 13 to 16 months. A calf is born in autumn weighing almost 400 pounds and measuring up to seven feet in length. A calf will remain with its mother for at least two years.</p>

      <p><strong>Tarantulas</strong></p><img src="img/tarantula.jpeg" id="spider">

        <p><h2>Appearance and physiology</h2>

Tarantulas’ size and coloring can vary wildly depending on location and species. From front right leg to rear left leg, tarantulas range from 4.5 to 11 inches (11.4 to 28 centimeters) in length. They weigh from 1 to 3 ounces (28.3 to 85 grams) and have strong jaws and fangs. “The position of the fangs is distinctive as they are parallel to each other and face downwards like a vampire’s,” said Jo-Anne Nina Sewlal, an arachnologist at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad. While many tarantulas are dull brown or black, some species are brilliantly colored or striped.

“Probably [tarantulas’] most distinctive physical characteristic is that they possess very hairy legs and bodies,” said Sewlal. She explained that some species use these bristly hairs, called urticating hairs, as a defense mechanism. If the attacker makes physical contact with the spiders, the hairs can be “rubbed off on . . . [or,] flicked toward potential attackers. These hairs are quite irritating if they land on the eyes or mucus membranes.”

Tarantulas periodically molt, shedding their exoskeletons to grow. According to the Saskatchewan Science Centre, while tarantulas are molting, they can also replace internal organs — including female genitalia or stomach lining. They can even regrow lost legs or pedipalps (short sensory appendages).

Tarantulas are by no means tiny, but Sewlal noted that if they are threatened, they will raise their front two pairs of legs in the air. “This gives the impression that they are larger than they really are.”

<h2>Feeding</h2>

Tarantulas primarily eat insects, though some species enjoy larger game like frogs, mice and small lizards.

According to Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine, most terrestrial species of tarantulas are burrowers. Unlike many spider species, tarantulas do not use webs to catch their prey. They do, however, spin silk. If a tarantula lives in a place with dry soil, it will burrow into the ground and line the walls of the hole with silk to help keep sand and dirt out. If a tarantula does not burrow, it might spin a burrow out of silk, or live under a log or rock. Sometimes, tarantulas spin a line of silk near the entrance to a burrow, which, reports National Geographic, acts as a trip wire, alerting the spider to prey that is nearing its home.

According to the San Diego Zoo, when prey comes close, tarantulas ambush it, seize it with their legs, paralyze it with venom, and then kill it with their fangs. They can also crush prey with their strong jaws. After the prey is dead, tarantulas inject digestive enzymes into the prey to liquefy the body and suck it up through their straw-like mouths.

<h2>Mating</h2>

Sewlal described tarantulas’ distinctive mating ritual. Before he can mate, the male spins a “small special web” and sprays it with sperm. Afterward, he rubs himself on the web, loading his pedipalps with it. He then searches for a female’s burrow, using the pheromones she gives off as a guide. According to the National Parks Service, when a male tarantula finds a female burrow, he “taps his foot to alert the female to his presence.”

If she is receptive, she will emerge from her burrow, and the male will begin a series of courtship displays, including lowering the front of his body, raising his abdomen, shaking his pedipalps, and moving back and forth, according to Sewlal. If she is not interested, Sewlal said, she will either “attack him or pay no attention to him.”

He then mates with the female, holding her fangs back with his legs. When he’s finished, he “makes a quick getaway since females will often try to eat the males after mating,” said Sewlal.

<h2>Taxonomy/classification</h2>

According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), the taxonomy of tarantulas is:
  <ul>

    <li>Kingdom: Animalia</li>
    <li>Subkingdom: Bilateria</li>
    <li>Infrakingdom: Protostomia</li>
    <li>Superphylum: Ecdysozoa</li>
    <li>Phylum: Arthropoda</li>
    <li>Subphylum: Chelicerata</li>
    <li>Class: Arachnida</li>
    <li>Order: Araneae</li>
    <li>Family: Theraphosidae</li>

        <h2>Natural History</h2>
Sea turtles travel far and wide, riding currents across the open ocean. Females return to the same beach each year, using magnetic clues as a map back home. Under the cover of darkness, the mother climbs onto the beach to lay close to 100 eggs each. She then buries them under a sandy blanket and returns to the sea.

After about two months the eggs hatch. On a mad dash for the sea, newly hatched sea turtles scurry to escape animals that want to eat them.

For turtles, shells are natural suits of armor that protect them from predators. Sea turtles can't draw their arms, legs and heads into their shells, but their large size and scaly, tough neck skin also help protect them from predators.

Over millions of years, the forelegs of sea turtles have changed to flipper-shaped blades, which help them "fly" through the water—sometimes as fast as 15 miles (24 km) per hour. Sea turtles use their hind feet as rudders.

Instead of teeth, these turtles have sharp beaks, which allow them to cut and tear their food. Sea turtles can drink sea water because they have glands near their eyes that remove excess salt.

<h2>Conservation</h2>
Sea turtles face many threats, including loss of nesting beaches due to development, hunting, egg harvesting and pollution. They're also caught accidentally as bycatch, though the fishing industry has developed "turtle excluder devices," trap doors in shrimp nets that allow turtles to escape. The green sea turtle is on the red (endangered) list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).

But soon they'll face even bigger challenges. As the ocean warms and sea levels rise, sea turtles will struggle to find enough food, mates and nesting beaches. And rising temperatures could also upset the balance of male and female turtles. Warmer eggs become females, while cooler eggs become males. If beaches get too warm, scientists worry there could be too many females—and not enough males to fertilize their eggs.

<h2>Cool Facts</h2>
Green sea turtles get their name from an internal layer of green fat.

Many islands around the world are known as "turtle islands" because they host nesting green sea turtles.

Green sea turtles can live to be 80 years old.

Sea turtles breathe oxygen, but can stay underwater for up to two hours before coming to the surface and taking one explosive breath.

Sea turtles rid themselves of excess salt through a "salt gland" near each eye, making them appear to be crying.

Turtles are reptiles, related to snakes, crocodiles and now-extinct dinosaurs.
